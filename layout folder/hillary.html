        <h3>LEARNING TO LIVE BY FAITH</h3>
        <P>
            When Reinhard Bonnke was a young man, he answered the call of God on his life. Leaving his home in Germany, he travelled to Wales to attend Swansea Bible College, known for its sound theology and emphasis on evangelism and missionary work. Despite his broken English in those early days, and without a cent to his name, he knew this was where the Lord had told him to get the training he needed. And the lessons he learnt there went far beyond theologyâ€¦

            <P>
                Our last Gospel crusade of the year ended on a very high note. The crowds more than doubled the last night. There were many tens of thousands of decisions for Christ documented (the team is still counting the decision cards) and so many amazing miracles took place!

            <h3>DOUBLE HARVEST</h3>
            <P>
                Tonight dark, ominous clouds threatened our program and torrential rains soaked the area surrounding our field, but thankfully, we remained dry. The gospel was preached. The power of God touched thousands of people, and Jesus was glorified! In addition to our Fire conference (in the mornings) and the gospel Crusade (in the evenings), the Bootcamp students have continued their local outreaches as well. As of today, they have conducted 2,862 separate, individual outreaches and have documented 350,693 decisions for Christ!!
